<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The taste of a Nanaimo bar in a cheesecake! Can't get any better than this. Make in the jelly roll pan for serving a larger crowd. Result is thinner but still as tasty. (You will need to adjust baking time if you use the bigger pan.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 ½ cups crushed chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies (such as OREO® Cookies)

    </li> 
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped pecans</li>
     <li>½ cup flaked coconut</li>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li> 
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup custard powder (such as Bird's® Custard Powder)</li> 
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate</li> 
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, pecans, and coconut in a bowl until the mixture is well combined. Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, and refrigerate while making filling.</li>
    <li>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and custard powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, and beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating each until fully incorporated before adding the next. Layer the filling over the crust.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 40 minutes. Refrigerate the cheesecake until fully cold, at least 3 hours.</li>
    <li>Melt the semisweet chocolate in a saucepan over very low heat with the cream, and stir until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Pour the chocolate mixture over the cheesecake, spread with a spatula to cover the middle layer, and refrigerate until the topping is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve cold. Store leftovers in refrigerator.</li>
